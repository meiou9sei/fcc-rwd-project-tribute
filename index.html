        <h2>Who was カメババ?</h2>
        <p>カメババ (read: <i>kamebaba</i>, "Turtle Grandmother") was a lovely woman who passed
        away at the age of 142 on July 9, 2021. She was a loving Grandmother, former President,
        and constructed the first Denny's on the Moon. She also reestablished Pluto as the 9th
        planet of our solar system, created world hunger so she could end it, and established the
        concept of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_food_restaurant">fast food restaurants</a>
        and is generally regarded as the pinnacle of the Panzermensch species, better than even that bastard <a target="_blank" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_(TV_series)>Canadian Panzermensch Franklin</a>.
        <i>No, I did not kill her for this webpage. Please stop inquiring on the cause of her death.</i> </p>
